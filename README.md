### Description

![Game](screenshots/game.png "Game")
As73roids is a re imagination of the old classic, with a 70's feel,
with tributes to some of the games I like the most.
How long will you survive?

### Features
 - Basics

 - Gravity: When thrusting ship will slowly start to gain speed. But wont stop. In order to try to stop you need to face the opossite direction and thurst.

 - Energy: you have a limited amount of energy, shown on the bottom right. Energy will deplete as you shoot. The more powerful your shots, the more energy will take. Energy will slowly regenerate over time, and a little bit faster if you generate kinematic energy by Thrusting.
